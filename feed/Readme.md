# Why to create a service interface and the create a impl class for it ?

it is a good practice to create a service interface and an implementation class for it in many cases. This approach
offers several benefits:
Benefits of Using Service Interfaces and Implementations

    Decoupling: It decouples the client code from the implementation details. The client code depends on the interface, not on the concrete implementation, which allows you to change the implementation without affecting the client code.

    Testing: It makes unit testing easier. You can mock the service interface in your tests, which is useful for isolating the code under test.

    Flexibility: It allows you to provide different implementations of the same service interface. For example, you might have different implementations for different environments (e.g., a real service for production and a mock service for testing).

    Readability and Maintenance: It improves code readability and maintenance. It’s clear what the service is supposed to do from its interface, and the implementation details are kept separate.

    Dependency Injection: It works well with dependency injection frameworks like Spring, which rely on interfaces to inject the appropriate beans at runtime.

# When Not to Use Interfaces

While using interfaces is generally good practice, there are scenarios where you might choose not to use them:

    Simple Applications: For small, simple applications, adding interfaces might introduce unnecessary complexity.
    YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It): If you are certain that your service will never have more than one implementation, and you do not need to mock it for testing, you might skip creating an interface initially.
    Prototype or Proof of Concept: During early stages of development or prototyping, you might focus on rapid development without interfaces. Refactoring to add interfaces can come later if the need arises.
